# NBA Player Performance Analysis: Veterans vs. Rookies in Away Games

## About This Project

This repository demonstrates my proficiency in Python, data collection, organization, and analysis. The project seeks to answer the question: **Do NBA veterans perform better in away games than rookies or less experienced players?** By showcasing my ability to work with data and apply statistical methods like regression analysis, this project highlights my skills in deriving meaningful insights from raw data.

## Project Objectives

- **Primary Question**: Do NBA veterans outperform rookies or less experienced players in away games?
- Demonstrate skills in:
  - **Python**: Leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `statsmodels` for data handling and statistical analysis.
  - **Data Collection**: Using APIs (e.g., NBA Stats API) to retrieve historical game and player data.
  - **Data Organization**: Cleaning and structuring data for efficient analysis.
  - **Regression Analysis**: Employing statistical models to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
  - **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to communicate findings effectively.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieve player stats and game data using the NBA Stats API.
   - Focus on metrics such as points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentages in away games.
   - Categorize players by experience (rookies, intermediate, and veterans).

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Ensure consistency in formats for seasons, player IDs, and game data.
   - Filter data for away games only.
   - Address missing or inconsistent data points.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Use regression models to explore the relationship between player experience and performance in away games.
   - Include control variables such as opponent strength, game location, and team quality.
   - Test the statistical significance of player experience as a predictor of performance.

4. **Future Steps**:
   - Expand the analysis to include home games for a complete comparison.
   - Add advanced metrics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and True Shooting Percentage (TS%).
   - Create visualizations to communicate findings clearly.

## Current Progress

- [x] Data collection framework implemented.
- [x] Player experience calculation completed.
- [ ] Initial exploratory analysis.
- [ ] Regression model development and analysis.
- [ ] Final visualizations and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`
- **Data Sources**: NBA Stats API
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## Expected Outcomes
A statistical comparison of away-game performance between NBA veterans and rookies.
Insights into whether experience contributes significantly to player performance under the pressure of away games.
Visualizations and summary tables to support the regression findings.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress and is intended to showcase my technical skills rather than provide definitive conclusions. Final results and insights will be documented upon project completion.
